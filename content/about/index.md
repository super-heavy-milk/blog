I'm Tyler Lawton, a software engineer living and working in Pittsburgh, PA.

The posts on this site are my notes, polished a bit so that they have some narrative structure. Usually they are half-finished, but I like to get them out and then iterate on them as I have time.

## Work

I worked on an E-commerce Search Platform for the past 4.5 years.

See my CV _(pending)_ for more details.

## Life

I recently got engaged to a lovely, amazing woman.

We have two cats, Poof and Almy (Alma Jean).

## Hobbies

Avid reader _(mostly pulpy sci-fi/fantasy with a smattering of literature)_.

Lifelong musician - primarily upright bass but other stuff too.

I oscillate between mountain biking, rock climbing and weight lifting when I want to move.

## Contact

Send me an email at me@tylerlawton.dev if you want to get in touch.
