Believe it or not, I wasn't always a _tech guy_.

In my early 20's, I was obsessed with music, to the point of obtaining a _Bachelor's of Music_ with a concentration in _Sound Recording_. I wanted desperately to be a cool studio musician/engineer like [Steve Albini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini) or [Nigel Godrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich). This period was roughly in the years 2008-2013; in my youthful naiveté, I was unconcerned with the recession that had rocked my country. It also helped that I had no money or career to lose, so I simply followed my passion.

Alas, like many who chased the music dragon, it did not work out for me. My own goals began to change in my mid-20's as well. The "starving artist" lifestyle that had once seemed so _vital_ and _real_ had begun to feel more like _poverty_ and _total lack of upwards mobility_. My "side gig" of waiting tables had turned into my only reliable source of income. At a certain point, I had to make a difficult decision: _what next?_

At this point in the story, it's the mid-2010s.

The [learn to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learn_to_Code) meme hasn't yet calcified into a bitter joke, and has fully saturated the cultural collective unconscious. I'm just the right combination of curious, desperate and impressionable to get caught up in the undertow and so I resign myself to learning the drudgery of _feeding a computer cryptic instructions till it does things_. Plus, it seems like that's where all the other failed creative types are ending up, so I might as well try to catch the wave.

This turns out to be lengthy process for me, involving community college, learning calculus in my mid-20s, grad school, and IBM Mainframes.

> _Yeah... IBM Mainframes. I was convinced that was going to be my edge._

Eventually though, it pays off, and in January 2020, I end up landing a gig at a Large Corporation™ working on an _enterprise™ e-commerce search platform_.

For the first time in my life, I'm challenged by a _job_.

This is quite the upheaval. Other things have been challenging for me, but they have never correlated to, _uh_, my income. Somewhat surprisingly, I find myself relishing the challenge, and dig into my new career with gusto. It helps that the pandemic has begun, and I have plenty of free time to hone my new craft.

A year, then two go by.

Impostor syndrome, something I'm familiar with from my time as a musician, plagues me with a dogged determination throughout this phase _(and still does, if I'm honest)_. I don't let it get me down though, as I finally have the thing that I've been grinding for years in hopes of achieving: _real experience as a Software Engineer™_.

I've found my golden ticket. No more worries about retirement, affording care for ageing parents, dodging questions about my career _(or lack thereof)_ on dates, etc. I even have begun to enjoy this new gig. It's interesting, and empowering in a way that I never experienced in other pursuits.

Hell, it's even fun - _Vim_, for example, is practically text editing as a game.

## Reality Bytes

Here's the thing.

The whole reason I went into tech can be boiled down into _a desire for stability_.

> _Tech was (and is) sold as a meritocracy._

If you can put in the work, and learn to deliver, then you can find success. My music school days taught me that I could put in the hours to learn stuff, and so it seemed like a natural fit. I was mostly right about that.

Where I was _wrong_ was thinking that if I broke past a certain threshold, then I would be set for life.

This month, my manager was laid off and my team was downsized from six to two devs. Those remaining two now report to an offshore team. I suspect this is mostly due to the _corporate policy du jour_ surrounding tech layoffs recently, but I'm not blind to the fact that an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do.

Did you catch that?

> _...an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do._

I was too expensive.

My hard-earned knowledge and skills were powerless in the face of a red cell on a spreadsheet somewhere.

The lesson here is that the aforementioned _meritocracy_ doesn't really ever let up. This profession, for better or worse, demands continuous improvement.

> _Or maybe it's luck. Or I was born 20 years too late. Or that in a John Henry-esque showdown with ChatGPT, I would ~~probably~~ definitely lose._

## Wrap

So, what - _"Tech is a meritocracy and you need to work harder and/or smarter and there's no room for reasonable and steady progress"_ - that's the big takeaway?

It's a bit disheartening to get laid off while hearing about record profits and a booming economy. Add that every MBA you've ever met is just absolutely frothing at the mouth to replace you with a chatbot and now you've really got a stew cookin'.

> _"Just learn a trade" doesn't have a Wikipedia page yet, maybe I'll try that._

I don't have a feel good ~~lie~~ solution that I can tell myself yet so I'll just have to focus on getting a job for now. I think that's all you can do.

## Wrap

I've mentioned several times in this article that I started in music. Music rewards excellence. I would argue that excellence actually is the "product" that music delivers.

Tech work actually doesn't reward excellence _per se_, or at least most jobs in tech don't.

It's seductive to think about your work as having quantifiable "excellence", but the reality is that your work and skills are usually just a means to an end for most companies.

> _A product can be excellent even if the underlying code is "ugly"._

It's like your home router - you don't actually care about the damn thing, you just want your internet to work. That's how most businesses are going to view what you do as a Software Engineer. They are going to want the thing you provide to (1) work and (2) be as cheap as possible.
