			<p>Believe it or not, I wasn&rsquo;t always a <em>tech guy</em>.</p>
<p>In my early 20&rsquo;s, I was obsessed with music, to the point of obtaining a <em>Bachelor&rsquo;s of Music</em> with a concentration in <em>Sound Recording</em>. I wanted desperatly to be a cool studio musician/engineer like Steve Albini or Nigel Goodrich. This period was roughly in the years 2008-2013; in my youthful naiveté, I was unconcerned with the recession that had rocked my country. It also helped that I had no money or career to lose, so I simply followed my passion.</p>
<p>Alas, like many who chased the music dragon, it did not work out for me. My own dreams began to change in my 20&rsquo;s as well. The &ldquo;starving artist&rdquo; lifestyle that had once seemed so <em>vital</em> and <em>real</em> had begun to feel more like <em>poverty</em> and <em>total lack of mobility</em>. The &ldquo;side gig&rdquo; of waiting tables to make ends meet had turned into my only reliable source of income, and at a certain point, I had to make a difficult decision: <em>what next?</em></p>
<h1 id="fish-in-a-barrel">Fish In A Barrel</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Give a man some code and he&rsquo;ll&hellip; um&hellip; code&hellip; for a day.</p>
<p>Teach a man to code and he&rsquo;ll&hellip; uh&hellip; code for his or family or something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in the story, it&rsquo;s the mid-2010s.</p>
<p>The <em>learn to code</em> meme by now has fully saturated the cultural collective unconscious, and so I resign myself to learning the drudgery of <em>making computers do stuff</em>. It seems like that&rsquo;s where all the other failed creative types end up, so I might as well hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>This turns out to be lengthy process for me, involving Community College, learning calculus in my mid-20s, grad school, and Mainframe computers. Eventually though, it pays off, and in January 2020, I end up landing a gig at a Large Corporation™  working on an <em>e-commerce enterprise search platform</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I&rsquo;m challenged by a <em>job</em>.</p>
<p>This is quite the upheaval. Other things have been challenging for me, but they have never correlated to, <em>uh</em>, the thing that makes me money. I find myself relishing the challenge, and dig into my new career with gusto. It helps that the pandemic has begun, and I find myself with free time to spare to hone my new craft.</p>
<p>A year, then two go by.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome, something I&rsquo;m very familiar with from my time as a musician, plagues me with a dogged determination throughout this phase (and still does, if I&rsquo;m honest). I don&rsquo;t let it get me down though, as I finally have the thing that I&rsquo;ve been grinding for years for: <em>real, actual experience as a Software Engineer</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found my golden ticket. No more worries about retirement, providing for ageing parents, not amounting to anything, etc. I even have begun to enjoy this new career. It&rsquo;s interesting, and empowering in a way that I never experienced in other pursuits. Hell, it&rsquo;s even fun - <em>Vim</em>, for example, is practically text editing as a game.</p>
<h1 id="reality-bytes">Reality Bytes</h1>
<p>My first real foray into programming began in 2015 with some Java classes at Community College, so my knowledge of programming was of the <em>hard-earned</em>  and <em>badly-optimized</em> variety. I also didn&rsquo;t have the advantage of going to a school with a rich culture steeped in programming lore and practice; my exposure to &ldquo;hacker culture&rdquo; came mostly from reading Neal Stephenson books and listening to the <em>Shop Talk</em> podcast. Heck, I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of <em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hackernews</a></em> till after finding my first programming job.</p>
<p>So, the aforementioned &ldquo;grind&rdquo; was very real for me during those years, and I really didn&rsquo;t even <em>like</em> the craft of programming yet. It was more of a means to an end.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The whole reason I went into tech can be boiled down into <em>a desire for stability</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech was <em>(and is)</em> sold as a meritocracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can put in the work, and learn to deliver, then you can find success. My music school days taught me that I could put in the hours to learn stuff, and so it seemed like a natural fit. I was mostly right about that.</p>
<p>Where I was <em>wrong</em> was thinking that if I broke past a certain threshold, then I would be set for life.</p>
<p>This month, my manager was laid off and my six person team was downsized to two devs who now report to an offshore team. I suspect this is mostly due to the <em>corporate policy du jour</em> surrounding tech layoffs recently, but I&rsquo;m not blind to the fact that an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do.</p>
<p>Did you catch that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, I was just an expense. And that&rsquo;s ok, honestly.</p>
<h1 id="wrap">Wrap</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned several times in this article that I started in music. Music rewards excellence. I would argue that excellence actually is the &ldquo;product&rdquo; that music delivers.</p>
<p>Tech actually doesn&rsquo;t reward excellence <em>per se</em>, or at least most jobs in tech don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seductive to think about your work as having quantifiable &ldquo;excellence&rdquo;, but the reality is that it&rsquo;s is usually just a means to an end for most companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your home router - you don&rsquo;t actually care about the damn thing, you just want your internet to work. That&rsquo;s how most businesses are going to view what you do as a Software Engineer. They are going to want what you provide to (1) work and (2) be as cheap as possible.</p>
