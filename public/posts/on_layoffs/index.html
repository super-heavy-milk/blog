				<p>Believe it or not, I wasn&rsquo;t always a <em>tech guy</em>.</p>
<p>In my early 20&rsquo;s, I was obsessed with music, to the point of obtaining a <em>Bachelor&rsquo;s of Music</em> with a concentration in <em>Sound Recording</em>. I wanted desperately to be a cool studio musician/engineer like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini">Steve Albini</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>. This period was roughly in the years 2008-2013; in my youthful naiveté, I was unconcerned with the recession that had rocked my country. It also helped that I had no money or career to lose, so I simply followed my passion.</p>
<p>Alas, like many who chased the music dragon, it did not work out for me. My own goals began to change in my mid-20&rsquo;s as well. The &ldquo;starving artist&rdquo; lifestyle that had once seemed so <em>vital</em> and <em>real</em> had begun to feel more like <em>poverty</em> and <em>total lack of upwards mobility</em>. My &ldquo;side gig&rdquo; of waiting tables had turned into my only reliable source of income. At a certain point, I had to make a difficult decision: <em>what next?</em></p>
<h2 id="fish-in-a-barrel">Fish In A Barrel</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Give a man some code and he&rsquo;ll&hellip; um&hellip; code&hellip; for a day.</em></p>
<p><em>Teach a man to code and he&rsquo;ll&hellip; uh&hellip; code for his or family or something.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in the story, it&rsquo;s the mid-2010s.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learn_to_Code">learn to code</a> meme hasn&rsquo;t yet calcified into a bitter joke, and has fully saturated the cultural collective unconscious. I&rsquo;m just the right combination of curious, desperate and impressionable to get caught up in the undertow and so I resign myself to learning the drudgery of <em>feeding a computer cryptic instructions till it does things</em>. Plus, it seems like that&rsquo;s where all the other failed creative types are ending up, so I might as well hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>This turns out to be lengthy process for me, involving community college, learning calculus in my mid-20s, grad school, and IBM Mainframes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah&hellip; IBM Mainframes. I was convinced that was going to be my edge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually though, it pays off, and in January 2020, I end up landing a gig at a Large Corporation™  working on an <em>enterprise™ e-commerce search platform</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I&rsquo;m challenged by a <em>job</em>.</p>
<p>This is quite the upheaval. Other things have been challenging for me, but they have never correlated to, <em>uh</em>, my income. Somewhat surprisingly, I find myself relishing the challenge, and dig into my new career with gusto. It helps that the pandemic has begun, and I have plenty of free time to hone my new craft.</p>
<p>A year, then two go by.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome, something I&rsquo;m very familiar with from my time as a musician, plagues me with a dogged determination throughout this phase <em>(and still does, if I&rsquo;m honest)</em>. I don&rsquo;t let it get me down though, as I finally have the thing that I&rsquo;ve been grinding for years in hopes of achieving: <em>real, actual experience as a Software Engineer™</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found my golden ticket. No more worries about retirement, affording care for ageing parents, dodging questions about my career <em>(or lack thereof)</em> on dates, etc. I even have begun to enjoy this new gig. It&rsquo;s interesting, and empowering in a way that I never experienced in other pursuits.</p>
<p>Hell, it&rsquo;s even fun - <em>Vim</em>, for example, is practically text editing as a game.</p>
<h2 id="reality-bytes">Reality Bytes</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The whole reason I went into tech can be boiled down into <em>a desire for stability</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tech was (and is) sold as a meritocracy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can put in the work, and learn to deliver, then you can find success. My music school days taught me that I could put in the hours to learn stuff, and so it seemed like a natural fit. I was mostly right about that.</p>
<p>Where I was <em>wrong</em> was thinking that if I broke past a certain threshold, then I would be set for life.</p>
<p>This month, my manager was laid off and my team was downsized from six to two devs. Those remaining two now report to an offshore team. I suspect this is mostly due to the <em>corporate policy du jour</em> surrounding tech layoffs recently, but I&rsquo;m not blind to the fact that an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do.</p>
<p>Did you catch that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&hellip;an offshore dev costs significantly less than I do.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, I was just an expense.</p>
<p>My hard-earned knowledge and skills were powerless in the face of a red cell on a spreadsheet somewhere.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that the aforementioned <em>meritocracy</em> doesn&rsquo;t really ever let up. This profession, for better or worse, demands continuous improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Or maybe it&rsquo;s luck. Or I was born 20 years too late. Or that in a John Henry-esque showdown with ChatGPT, I would <del>probably</del> definitely lose.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap</h2>
<p>So, what - <em>&ldquo;Tech is a meritocracy and you need to work harder and/or smarter and there&rsquo;s no room for reasonable and steady progress&rdquo;</em> - that&rsquo;s the big takeaway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit disheartening to get laid off while hearing about record profits and a booming economy. Add that every MBA you&rsquo;ve ever met is just absolutely frothing at the mouth to replace you with a chatbot and now you&rsquo;ve really got a stew cookin'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Just learn a trade&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have a Wikipedia page yet, maybe I&rsquo;ll try that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a feel good <del>lie</del> solution that I can tell myself yet so I&rsquo;ll just have to focus on getting a job for now. I think that&rsquo;s all you can do.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-1">Wrap</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned several times in this article that I started in music. Music rewards excellence. I would argue that excellence actually is the &ldquo;product&rdquo; that music delivers.</p>
<p>Tech work actually doesn&rsquo;t reward excellence <em>per se</em>, or at least most jobs in tech don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seductive to think about your work as having quantifiable &ldquo;excellence&rdquo;, but the reality is that your work and skills are usually just a means to an end for most companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A product can be excellent even if the underlying code is &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your home router - you don&rsquo;t actually care about the damn thing, you just want your internet to work. That&rsquo;s how most businesses are going to view what you do as a Software Engineer. They are going to want the thing you provide to (1) work and (2) be as cheap as possible.</p>
