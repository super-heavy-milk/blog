      <description>Introduction What is a Stack? FIFO LIFO Bags Implementations Array-Based FIFO Stack Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to go through some DSA (Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms) stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten in my time as a digital plummer at my last job.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s humbling, to say the least. I suck at it. In my somewhat limited experience, most of Software Engineering is stitching together disparate systems and turning out product features as fast as humanly possible.</description>

      <description>Overview This is going to be a long one.&#xA;I forgot to renew my CompTIA Security+ certification, so I&amp;rsquo;m re-taking it. What a treat. I&amp;rsquo;m using CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide by Darril Gibson because the kindle edition was cheap and recommended. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it goes!&#xA;Note that I&amp;rsquo;m just jotting stuff down for my own benefit, I&amp;rsquo;m not promising any kind of coherence heh.</description>

      <title>Imperative vs Declarative</title>

      <description>Short post today, simple premise:&#xA;Try to be declarative if possible.&#xA;Small aside:&#xA;One of the reasons I started writing about programming is that most of the tech blogs I enjoy tend to provide examples in &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; languages - Rust, Go, Lisp, etc. However, most of us are stuck writing in Enterprise Approved™ languages, so I thought it would be neat to write about the mostly uncool languages I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with *cough Java*.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a tech guy.&#xA;In my early 20&amp;rsquo;s, I was obsessed with music, to the point of obtaining a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s of Music with a concentration in Sound Recording. I wanted desperately to be a cool studio musician/engineer like Steve Albini or Nigel Godrich. This period was roughly in the years 2008-2013; in my youthful naiveté, I was unconcerned with the recession that had rocked my country.</description>

      <description>This is a nice &amp;rsquo;lil script for rolling back a k8s deployment.&#xA;Note: this generates the command so you can copy it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually execute it&#xA;#!/usr/bin/env bash function undo_k8s_deployment() { local ctx name_space k8s_deployment k8s_revision command # choose a context ctx=$( kubectl config get-contexts -o name | awk &amp;#39;{print $1}&amp;#39; | fzf --prompt &amp;#34;Select a k8s context &amp;#34; ) [[ -z &amp;#34;$ctx&amp;#34; ]] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &amp;#34;No k8s context selected, exiting.</description>
